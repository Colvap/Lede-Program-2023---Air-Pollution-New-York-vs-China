# Project-1-Lede-Program---Air-Pollution-New-York-vs-China
 
In early June 2023, I was in New York doing the Lede Prgram in Data Journalism at Columbia University. This coincided with Armaggedon-level ochre skies that smelt of charcoal due to wildfires in Canada. I wondered if the AQI level had ever been this bad while I was living in Beijing 2019-2022...I checked the AQI levels over the past three years, and yes it had been, many times, but I had never really taken notice of it. Why? Was it because the skies had never turned orange before in Beijing? Well they had, multiple times, especially in sandstorms. Was it the level of publicity New York's skies had gotten on the news, and how seriously everyone was treating it? Perhaps that was it - this was not normal by US standards, whereas in Beijing it's frequent enough to no longer make headlines. The Chinese government is also pushing legislation to cut down on air pollution - cleaner air and cleaner skies felt the norm while I was in Beijing, rather than the exception. 

I wondered if it was possible to compare what Chinese cities considered bad enough to attract attention, and what New York does. The html file shows my results - that although New York's air pollution levels are still much healthier than China on average, levels that are considered record-breaking by the two countries are **_slowly converging_**.
